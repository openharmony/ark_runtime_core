# Test description:
#   Check `i64toi32` with incorrect accumulator type.
#   Load different values (objects, strings, types, 64-bit floating point values, 32-bit integer values) and invokes `i64tof64`.
#   Return 0 to indicate that negative test failed, because this line is unreachable and code will not be executed after verification error.
