  - title: Dynamic indirect call
    description: Call 'any' value that represents a function, i.e. create a new frame,
      pass values of arguments and continue execution from the first instruction of
      a method. Callee should treat accumulator value as undefined and cannot use it
      until accumulator definition in the new frame. The callee must always return the
      result in the accumulator. First source register contains a function 'any' value,
      other imm source registers contain arguments of a function. Non-range instructions
      can be used to pass up to 4 arguments (unused register slot values will be discarded
      and corresponding registers will not be passed to the callee). For methods with
      more arguments range kind of instruction is to be used, which takes the needed
      number of arguments starting from 'v' register.
