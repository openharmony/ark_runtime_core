module:
  name: arkbase
  # It is better to name this namespace simply "panda::base", but there is already namespace "ecmascript::base", which
  # is used just as "base", hence it conflicts with this namespace. I fixed it by renaming base->ecmascript::base in
  # this repository, but there is the external repository ark_js_runtime, which uses us as an external library and has
  # the same problem with "ecmascript::base". So, I've gave up and renamed it to "base_options".
